# Universe
About the project:
This is a thing I create at the moment centered around gravity and planets.

Controlls:
  - WASD to move in the scean
  - Clicking in a free-space spawns a new planet
  - Clicking on a planet: have your camera locked to this planet
  - Q: unlock the kamera
  - Dragging a planet: move the planet
  - Pressing X: Delets the selected planet (if you have selected one)
  - Clicking on the same planet you selected copys his data to your textinputs
  - Clicking "Edit" edits the selected planet
  - Clicking "Clear" clears all planets
  - the textinputs from up to down, left to right: Name, Color(hex),      Radius, Mass, Velocity(x), Velocity(y), overall Gravity



Working for now:
  - gravity 
  - movement
  - planets
  - collisions
  - camera follow
  - you can delete Planets 
  - name and mass is displayed
  - colorcollision
  - Editable Planets

Bugs you should be aware of:

Need to Improve:
  - music to loud (mby fade)
  - soundeffects (planets collide, place)
  - mixing colors depends on mass
  - dragging planets arround doesnt work
this application is develloped by: 
  - Linus Andersen (programmer)
  - Julius Andersen (music)
