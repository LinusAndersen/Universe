# Universe
About the project:
This is a thing I create at the moment centered around gravity and planets.

Controlls:
  - WASD to move in the scean
  - the 3 textinputs are radius/mass, start-velocity-x and start-velocity-y of a new planet
  - clicking in a free-space spawns a new planet
  - clicking on a planet: have your camera locked to this planet
  - Q: unlock the kamera
  - dragging a planet: move the planet
  - Pressing D: Delets the selected Planet (if you have selected one)


Working for now:
  - basic things like gravity, movement, planets, collisions, camera follow, size is displayed

Bugs you should be aware of:
  - try to have the canvas in the top left corner of your browser
  - the 3 text inputs have to be filled before spawning a planet

Need to Improve:
  - GUI(see Concept-Universe.png), music, zoom

this application is develloped by: 
  - Linus Andersen (programmer)
