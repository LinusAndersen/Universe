# Universe
About the project:
This is a thing I create at the moment centered around gravity and planets.

Controlls:
  - WASD to move in the scean
  - the 3 textinputs are radius/mass, start-velocity-x and start-velocity-y of a new planet
  - clicking in a free-space spawns a new planet
  - clicking on a planet shows you the planets mass


Working for now:
  - basic things like gravity, movement, planets, collisions

Bugs you should be aware of:
  - try to have the canvas in the top left corner of your browser
  - the 3 text inputs have to be filled before spawning a planet

Need to Improve:
  - better visuels, music, GUI

this application is develloped by: 
  Linus Andersen (programmer)
