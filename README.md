# Universe
About the project:
This is a thing I create at the moment centered around gravity and planets.

Controlls:
  - WASD to move in the scean
  - The 3 textinputs are radius/mass, start-velocity-x and start-velocity-y of a new planet
  - Clicking in a free-space spawns a new planet
  - Clicking on a planet: have your camera locked to this planet
  - Q: unlock the kamera
  - Dragging a planet: move the planet
  - Pressing X: Delets the selected Planet (if you have selected one)


Working for now:
  - gravity 
  - movement
  - planets
  - collisions
  - camera follow
  - you can delete Planets 
  - name and mass is displayed
  - colorcollision
  - Editable Planets

Bugs you should be aware of:
  - try to have the canvas in the top left corner of your browser
  - the text inputs have to be filled before spawning a planet

Need to Improve:
  - GUI(see Concept-Universe.png)
  - music
  - zoom
  - edit Planets

this application is develloped by: 
  - Linus Andersen (programmer)
